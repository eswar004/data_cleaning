# 📊 Data Cleaning with Python – ETL Style Workflow

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world data cleaning and preprocessing workflow using Python and Pandas.

A synthetic marketing campaign dataset was generated with intentional data quality issues to simulate real-world messy production data. The goal was to clean, standardize, and transform the raw dataset into an analysis-ready structured format.

This project reflects practical data engineering and ETL-style preprocessing techniques used in industry.

- Duplicate column names
- Inconsistent categorical labels
- Random formatting inconsistencies
- Data type mismatches

---

## 🧹 Cleaning & Transformation Steps

The notebook applies the following preprocessing techniques:

- Removing duplicate columns
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing categorical variables
- Converting mixed-format dates
- Type casting and validation
- Data integrity checks
- Preparing structured output for analytics
